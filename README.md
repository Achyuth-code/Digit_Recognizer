# 🖥️ Digit Recognizer

Welcome to the Digit Recognizer project! This project uses machine learning techniques to recognize handwritten digits from images. It is a fun and educational way to explore digit recognition using Python and deep learning frameworks.

## 🚀 Features

- **📸 Handwritten Digit Recognition**: Recognizes digits from 0 to 9.
- **📊 Data Visualization**: Visualize the training data and results.
- **🤖 Model Training**: Train your own model using popular ML algorithms.
- **🛠️ User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to use with clear instructions.

## 📦 Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib pandas
```

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) of handwritten digits. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

## 📝 Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/digit-recognizer.git
   cd digit-recognizer
   ```

2. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Run the `Digit_Recognizer.ipynb` file to start recognizing digits!
